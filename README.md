# ImageProcessing

### This C++ project created in Visual Studio is a small tool to resize any image using Bilinear Interpolation. 

### Steps for smooth functioning

All you need to do is run the .exe file alongwith 3 command-line arguments (image location path, scaling factor and the target path where the scaled image should be saved). I have used the OpenCV libraries to do this, and the opencv_world410.dll that is required for the correct functioning of this tool is available for download here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zjety8s6ljsksw6/opencv_world410.dll?dl=0.

Please add this .dll file to the /x64/Release/ path in your local machine before running this. Good luck! :)
